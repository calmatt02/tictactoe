CS50 AI Tic Tac Toe Game
<b> 
<p>
  Here's how it was made. The Tic Tac Toe game was implemented in python, using the minimax algorithm. This algorithm helps the AI determine the best move to make that will
  give the player the lowest score. In this case, it will try to pick a space where there's a vacancy, and that vacancy will disrupt the player's attempt to get three Xs or Os in a row, or diagonally.
